**Train-Free Skill Optimization Framework for LLMs**

Treat the System Prompt as "weights" and interaction feedback as "training signals" -- through Textual Gradient Descent (TGD), prompts evolve automatically. No training, no labeling, just API calls.

```
User Feedback -> Diagnose Failure -> Compute Text Gradient -> Beam Search Rewrite -> Better Agent
```

## Core Philosophy

TreeSkill draws an analogy between LLM prompt optimization and deep learning's training loop, but **requires no model training at all**:

| Deep Learning | TreeSkill |
|----------|----------|
| Model Weights | System Prompt |
| Training Data | Interaction Feedback (Human or LLM Judge) |
| Loss Function | Failure Case Analysis |
| Gradient | Text Gradient (failure attribution in natural language) |
| Parameter Update | Prompt Rewrite (Beam Search with multiple candidates) |
| Epoch | Optimization Round (with checkpoint resume support) |

## Features

- **Train-Free** -- Pure API calls; no GPU, no fine-tuning, no labeled data required
- **Human-in-the-Loop** -- Human feedback drives optimization: `/bad` to flag failures, `/rewrite` to provide ideal responses, `/target` to set optimization direction, letting domain experts directly participate in prompt evolution
- **Beam Search APO** -- Aligned with [Agent-Lightning](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-lightning/)'s optimization algorithm: multi-template gradient analysis x multi-candidate generation x Beam Search selection, continuously retaining top-k prompts across optimization rounds
- **Model Agnostic** -- Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, and any OpenAI-compatible API (SiliconFlow, Ollama, etc.)
- **Agent Skills Standard** -- Skill files follow the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) open standard
- **Hierarchical Skill Tree** -- Automatic splitting, pruning, and grafting with recursive bottom-up optimization
- **Multi-Protocol Tool System** -- Skills can declare and invoke external tools in multiple formats:
  - **Python Scripts** -- Functions in `script.py` are automatically registered as tools
  - **HTTP API** -- Declarative invocation of any REST endpoint
  - **MCP Server** -- Tool invocation compatible with [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)
- **Checkpoint Resume** -- Resume from last progress after interruption, without wasting completed API calls
- **Plugin Registry** -- Customize every part of the optimization pipeline with `@scorer`, `@gradient`, `@rewriter`, `@skill_format` decorators ([Guide](../docs_en/REGISTRY_GUIDE.md))
- **Multi-Endpoint** -- Configure separate API endpoints, models, and protocols (OpenAI / Anthropic) for Actor / Judge / Rewrite roles
- **Kode CLI Integration** -- Use [Kode](https://github.com/shareAI-lab/Kode-Agent) as the agent forward engine; skills are executed and validated in a real agent loop
- **AgentHarness** -- Built-in lightweight agent loop with bash / file I/O / skill loading for skill evaluation without external dependencies

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JimmyMa99/TreeSkill.git
cd TreeSkill
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure API

```bash
cp demo/example/config.yaml my-config.yaml
# Edit my-config.yaml and fill in your API Key
```

Or use environment variables:

```env
TREE_LLM_API_KEY=your-api-key
TREE_LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1
TREE_LLM_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct
```

### 2. Launch

```bash
# Use an existing skill directory
python -m treeskill.main --config my-config.yaml --skill skills/fast-test-skill

# Use default skill (auto-created)
python -m treeskill.main --skill default

# Use a skill tree directory
python -m treeskill.main --skill my-skills/
```

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop Optimization

The core interaction mode of TreeSkill is **human-machine collaborative optimization**: domain experts guide the APO engine to improve prompts through natural language feedback.

```
You: Write a short essay about spring

Assistant: [generated result]

You: /bad Too AI-like, lacks a personal touch        <- Flag failure + reason
You: /rewrite Spring has arrived. The magnolias...    <- Provide ideal response (optional)
You: /target More human, with warmth and personality  <- Set optimization direction (optional)
You: /optimize                                       <- Trigger APO optimization

Skill optimized -> writing-assistant (v1.0 -> v1.1) (checkpoint saved)
```

Each `/bad` and `/rewrite` generates a Trace (an interaction record with feedback). When `/optimize` is triggered, the APO engine extracts failure patterns from these Traces, computes text gradients, and rewrites the prompt. **Domain experts don't need to understand prompt engineering -- they only need to judge whether the response is good or not.**

Dataset-driven mode is also supported:

```bash
# Fully automatic: LLM Judge scoring -> APO optimization, no human intervention
python -m treeskill.main --optimize --dataset train.jsonl --skill my-skill --no-resume

# Human-machine collaborative annotation: auto-judge scores, humans can override anytime (preference signals -> guide the judge)
python -m treeskill.main --annotate --dataset train.jsonl --skill my-skill

# Purely manual annotation
python -m treeskill.main --annotate --dataset train.jsonl --skill my-skill --manual
```

In annotation mode, human feedback serves as natural language preference signals, used both as input for APO gradients and exportable as DPO fine-tuning data.

In the CLI, typing `/` brings up a list of slash command candidates. As you type a command prefix, the list narrows down automatically, making it easy to discover and select available commands.

## Skill File Format

Following the [Agent Skills Standard](https://agentskills.io/specification), each Skill is a directory:

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # YAML frontmatter + Markdown body (= system prompt)
├── config.yaml       # Optional: few-shot, temperature, tool declarations, schedules, etc.
└── script.py         # Optional: Python tool functions
```

**SKILL.md Example:**

```markdown
---
name: my-writing-assistant
description: A professional writing assistant that helps draft and polish various texts.
metadata:
  version: "1.0"
  target: "More human-like, with warmth"
---

You are a professional writing assistant.
Your language should be natural and fluent. Avoid sounding like AI.
```

> See [docs/design/skill-format.md](./docs/design/skill-format.md) for details

## Tool System

Skills can declare external tools, and the agent invokes them as needed during conversation. Three protocols are supported:

**config.yaml declaration example:**

```yaml
tools:
  # HTTP API tool
  - name: weather
    type: http
    endpoint: https://api.weather.com/current
    method: GET
    description: Get current weather

  # MCP tool
  - name: database
    type: mcp
    mcp_server: localhost:5000
    tool_name: query
    description: Query the database
```

**script.py auto-registration:**

```python
# Public functions in script.py automatically become tools
def search_docs(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the document repository"""
    ...
```

Tool inheritance: child Skills automatically inherit their parent Skill's tool declarations, with same-name overrides.

> See [docs/TOOLS_GUIDE.md](./docs/TOOLS_GUIDE.md) for details

## Skill Tree

Skills form a hierarchy through directory nesting:

```
writing-skills/
├── SKILL.md              # Root: general writing
├── social/
│   ├── SKILL.md          # Social writing
│   └── moments/
│       └── SKILL.md      # Social media specialist
└── business/
    ├── SKILL.md          # Business writing
    └── email/
        └── SKILL.md
```

Optimization is bottom-up: leaf nodes first, then parent nodes. When feedback conflicts are detected, automatic splitting is suggested. Graft support enables cross-tree skill reuse.

> See [docs/design/tree-optimization.md](./docs/design/tree-optimization.md) for details

## APO Optimization Principles

The APO (Automatic Prompt Optimization) engine is aligned with [Agent-Lightning](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-lightning/)'s design. The core mechanism is **Beam Search + Textual Gradient Descent**:

```
                    +- Gradient Template 1 -+     +- Edit Template 1 (aggressive rewrite) -+
Failed Traces -->   +- Gradient Template 2 -+ --> +- Edit Template 2 (conservative fix)    -+ --> Score --> Top-K Beam
                    +- Gradient Template 3 -+     +- branch_factor candidates              -+
```

**Single-round flow:**

1. **Sample Traces** -- Select failure cases from feedback
2. **Compute Text Gradients** -- Randomly select a gradient template (3 types); the judge model analyzes "what in the prompt caused the failure"
3. **Generate Candidates** -- Randomly select an edit template (aggressive rewrite / conservative fix); each parent prompt generates `branch_factor` candidates
4. **Score and Select** -- Score all candidates + original beam, retain the top `beam_width`

**Two modes:**

| Mode | Configuration | Behavior |
|------|------|------|
| Single-track (default) | `beam_width=1` | One gradient -> N candidates -> select best; backward compatible |
| Beam Search | `beam_width>1` | Retain top-k prompts across rounds for more stable optimization |

Checkpoint resume is supported -- after interruption, `.evo_resume.json` records completed nodes, which are automatically skipped on the next run.

> See [docs/design/apo-optimization.md](./docs/design/apo-optimization.md) for details

## Checkpoint

Each optimization automatically saves a checkpoint:

```
ckpt/
└── writing-assistant_v1.2_20260306_140000/
    ├── skill/          # Complete skill tree
    │   └── SKILL.md
    └── mem/
        ├── traces.jsonl
        └── meta.json
```

```bash
# CLI restore
/ckpt                                                # List
/restore writing-assistant_v1.2_20260306_140000       # Restore

# Command-line restore
python -m treeskill.main --ckpt ckpt/writing-assistant_v1.2_20260306_140000
```
